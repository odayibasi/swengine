  * Audio Mechanism (Sound and Music Controls)
  * User Interaction Handling (Keyboard, Mouse, GamePad support)
  * Resource Handling (TGA, Shader and music files management)
  * Physics Mechanism (Fluid Simulation, Particle Systems, Rigid Body Simulation)
  * Game Helpers (Animators, Compositors, Sprite, Behavior Controllers, Paths)
  * Windowing System (Automatic Window Generation, Cursor, Toolbar..)
  * Utility Functions (String, Math, Formatters, etc..)

* SWEngine use next generation technologies in it's framework;
